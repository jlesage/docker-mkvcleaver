      MKVcleaver is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for mkvtoolnix, designed to extract
      data from MKV files. It can be used in a batch mode (loading and extracting data
      from many files) as well as single file mode. It has a simple GUI interface, but a
      lot of functionality.

      - title: Troubleshooting
        level: 2
        content: |-
          MKVCleaver is a Windows application running under Wine. This brings some quirks
          that are not seen with usual applications.
      - title: Remote Resize
        level: 3
        content: |-
          When using remote resizing, the application's window size won't adjust beyond
          the size defined by `DISPLAY_WIDTH` and `DISPLAY_HEIGHT`. Make sure to adjust
          these variables accordingly.
      - title: Dark Mode
        level: 3
        content: |-
          When dark mode is enabled, some labels have blue text that are hard to read.
          This color seems to be hard-coded by MKVCleaver itself and cannot be adjusted
          with the theme.
